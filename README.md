# Escape the Room by xenus
## Roster and Role:
- Biraj Chowdury (Python)
- Nahi Khan (HTML and CSS)
- Henry Liu (Project Manager)
- Albert Wan (Database and HTML)

## Project Overview
The overall goal of the project is to create a game with a storyline where players attempt to escape the universe Xenus. We will have puzzles like type racer, Galactica, trivia, chance, blackjack, snake and computation problems which will be timed and will only be available once the player completes the puzzles before that one. Through the use of REST APIs, JavaScript, Flask, and databases managed by SQLite, our site will give players a fun game that they won't want to stop playing.

## APIs Utilized:
[Diceful API](http://roll.diceapi.com/)
  - We will use this API to roll die for our chance game.

[Deck Of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)
  - We will use this API to get cards for our blackjack game.

[NBA Player API](https://nba-players.herokuapp.com)
  - we will use this API to get pictures for users' profile pictures.

[The Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
  - We will use this API to get trivia questions for use in our trivia game.
